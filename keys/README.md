# Test Keypairs

These are throwaway keys for devnet and testnet. They should not be used for production deploys.

The keys are stored in separate folders for `devnet` and `testnet`, but we are using the same keypairs and addresses on each network for testing, which are:

- `deployer-keypair`: `REPLACEME`.
- `program-keypair`: `REPLACEME`.
